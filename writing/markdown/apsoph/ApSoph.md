# Apollonius "the Sophist" #

The Homeric lexicon of Apollonius Sophistes, interlinear glosses in the Venetus, and the paraphrase of Michael Psellos represent three strains of the lexical commentary. The Lexicon consists of Homeric words defined. Some entries consist solely of a list of glosses or synonyms, such as the entry for δαήρ (<code
concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg1168.tlg001.hmt:delta.8</code>),
where we read <strong
concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">ἀνδρὼς ἀδελφός</strong>.

The interlinear glosses lie above the words they define or explicate. This is seen in βαθείαις (<code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msAil.hmt:1.274</code>), which glosses <strong
concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">κοίλῃσιν</strong>.


 The Psellos paraphrase presents glosses for difficult words in the context of a prose recast. Similarly, in 1.26 we read βαθείναισι for κοίλῃσιν.
