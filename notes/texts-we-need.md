- Interlinear scholia for Venetus A, book 15.  Not yet begun.  Need references to Dindorf and Erbse.  Immediate priority with Charlie Schufrieder.
- MID edition of (one or more letters of) Apollonius Sophistes, starting with delta.  Immediate priority with Corey and Michael.
- Marciana 841, book 15 paraphrase.  Partially done.  To continue with Alex after Omega 1.12 is done?
