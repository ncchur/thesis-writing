# Plans for second semester

### Do a more involved linguistic analysis of Psellos. That is to say, look at how words are glossed at each appearance, how these compare to interlinear glosses, and lexicon entries. Also look at how formulaic phrases are treated.   Requires:  book 15 in Omega 1.12 for paraphrase , and interlinear scholia in Ven. A for book 15, use both Bekker and what we have of Paris MS.

### Finish transcription of Marciana 841 book 15. After this is complete, I want to do a comparison between the texts of the omega 1.12 and 841. If there is enough time, I want to complete a transcription of the Munich text and then compare all three. 

### I also want to look at how the half lines are broken in the 841. This examination will consider how formula, grammar, and meter are treated in the break-up of the lines. To do this, I also need to consider what precisely I mean by "formula." 

### Complete MID edition of the Lexicon of Apollonius Sophistes.

### Complete a transcription of book 1.1-1.300 in Omega 1.12, Munich, and Marciana 454. Then look at how Ludwich's comparison of seventy lines compares with the analysis of the whole paraphrase in the 454 along with Psellos. 

### Compare the paraphrase in book 1 with Moschopoulos, Gaza, and Tzetzes. Compare 15 with Gaza and Tzetzes. Moschopoulos exists only in 1 and 2. This will involve finding an edition of Moschopolus and Gaza. I am not entirely certain how much of one exists for either at the moment, but that is something  I will continue to look into. Scholarship exists on Moschopoulos, so that might be a place to start.  Edition of Moschopoulos paraphrase of *Iliad* 1: S. Grandolini, "La parafrasi al primo libro dell'Iliade di Manuel Moschopulos," *Studi di onore di Aristide Colonna* (1982): 134-149.


### Continue hunt for Steinicke. We came very close to getting it at the end of the semester: Notre Dame's library claims to possess a copy, and they sent what they claimed to be that copy, but it was in fact Bekker's edition mis-labeled as Steinicke's. When we return to campus, I will try to work that out.
