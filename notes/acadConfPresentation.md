>- Psellos 15.15 εἰς τὴν φυγὴν ἔτρεψε 

>- Marciana 454 εἰς φυγὴν ἐτράπησαν

## Nature of the paraphrase

>-	Different from glosses

>- Needs to offer “gloss”/”translation” of every word

>-	Frequently similar words 

>-	Also feature of Lex. Hom. -> preserve word as much as possible

>-	E.g.
15.1 

Iliad: αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ διά τε σκόλοπας καὶ τάφρον ἔβησαν 
 
Paraphrase: ἐπειδὴ δὲ τούς τε σκόλοπας καὶ τὴν τάφρον διέβησαν

>-	Written for learned reader

>-	Convey sense, not word-for-word

>-	E.g.
*χαλκοχιτώνων* as *σιδηροθωρακῶν* at 15.56
