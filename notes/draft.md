# Introduction

The finish of this paper is not yet certain, but the process and general goal are to compare Byzantine paraphrases of the Iliad, particularly books 1 and 15, among each other and with the interlinear glosses from the Marciana 454 and to discern connections or relationships among them. The manuscripts to be investigated are Marciana 454, Marciana 841, Escorial Ω.I.12, and Genavensis 44. The Marciana 454’s paraphrase is distinct but has strinking similarities to Bekker's paraphrase (still need to do comparison with Psellos'), and the other three contain the so-called Psellos paraphrase. Psellos’ paraphrase pre-dates that of the Marciana 454 by approximately four hundred years. 




# Discussion of Manuscripts	


## Marciana 454
The Marciana 454, also referred to as the Venetus A, contains an interlinear paraphrase throughout book 1 and the approximately first third of book 2, which becomes more fragmentary after 1.175. This paraphrase is distinct among the other manuscripts being considered, but shares common features with the paraphrases of Psellos and Theodorus Gaza, as indicated by the comparison conducted by Ludwich (cf. Ludwich 513-515) (see table A for break-down of scripts of paraphrase.). As Ludwich observes, the hand of the paraphrase is younger than that of the main text (“jüngerer Hand (15. Jahrh.?), eine Interlinearparaphrase (darüber schweigt W. Dindorf in seiner Vorrede zu den Ilias-Scholien), die den oben besprcohenen nicht unwesentlich abweicht,“ Ludwich 493). Ludiwch observes the similarities among the "content words," but a comparison with Bekker's paraphrase shows an extensive similarity. Bekker did consult the 454 for his edition of the scholia in Iliadem, so he would have been at least familiar with the manuscript. Although it seems, according to certain footnotes in Bekker and the reference of Ludwich, that the text of Bekker's paraphrase derived mainly from the Paris. reg. manuscript, there is an undeniable similarity. According to Ioannis Vassis, "die [Paraphrase] von Immanuel Bekker als Appendix zu seiner Edition der Scholien zur Ilias (Bekker 1827) präsentierte Paraphrase des cod. Paris. gr. 2690, die größenteils der Psellos-Paraphrase angehört, bilden schließlich bis heute die einzigen vollständigen Ausgaben einer von Α bis Ω reichenden Ilias-Paraphrase" (Vassis 2), so the paraphrase of the Paris. gr. 2690 is related to that of Psellos, and indeed Vassis cites it fifth in his work with the siglum "b" .

## Marciana 841
 

The Marciana 841 begins in book 14, with 15 as the first complete book. MS 841 presents the text of the poem and the paraphrase by the half-line (hemistich). From a small sampling, one sees that the lines are cut without obvious consideration for the semantic content. This is not to say that the separation is arbitrary or without reason, but rather that the half-line demarcations appear to be based more on a syllabic or metrical basis than on a semantic one (see table B for cursory line-by-line analysis). The line split occurs most frequently in the third, and less often the fourth, foot.  
	


## Escorial Ω.I.12
The Escorial Ω.I.12 presents the same paraphrase family in parallel with full lines. 
	


# Comparisons

Based on the coincidence of the Psellos paraphrase and the scholia vulgata, Ludwich posits that the two come from an Ur-source, so that they represent divergent strains from the same family („Das Resultat kann nicht zweitehalt sein: an einer auffallend großen Anzahl von Stellen decken sich die Paraphrasen genau mit den Scholia vulg., am auffälligsten die Psellos-Paraphrase, die sogar das von den anderen Uebersetzern verschämhte /kaka// für /a)/legea/...uzw“ (Luwdich 515). Only Psellos is older than Schol. Vulg.; the others are definitely later. Scholia vulgata and Psellos might share “Q,” Ludwich 516). Spooner concurs, in some sense, with this point, “The continuous grammatical paraphrases on papyrus and tablets published to date match, not surprisingly, the scholia minora and D in their choice of vocabulary” (Spooner 23).

A comparison between the Bekker paraphrase and that of the Marciana 454 suggests similarities with consistent differences (see table c). (Vassis 12, Der Archetypos der Handschriften der Psellos-Paraphrase ist anderseits spätestens ins 11. Jh. zu setzen. Daß diese Paraphrase etwa eine gemeinsame Quelle mit den D-Scholien)

# Comparison of Psellos Paraphrase from Escorial Ω.I.12 with the text of the Iliad in book 15


The article is used more often in the paraphrase than in the text of the poem. Further, when the pronouns τόν and μιν are used in the text, αὐτόν is used in the paraphrase. When Danaans, Achaeans, and Argives are mentioned in the text, Hellenes is used almost universally in the parphrase. The particles generally remain the same; the continuity is interesting, especially because there is a two thousand year gap in the composition of the texts.

# On using the terms scholia minora and uulgata
The terms scholia minora, scholia vulgata, and D scholia are all used by various scholars to define and label certain groups of scholia that comment on the text of the Iliad text found in the mansucripts. While the terms have their uses, to be sure, in this paper the term "interlinear glosses" will be used to refer to a group of scholia which are both also used with the vulgata and minora appellations. The use of the term interlinear glosses is not without precedent: Wilhelm Dindorf deems this group, more or less, "glossemata interlinearea" in his edition of scholia.
Spooner 3, The use of the designation "scholia minora" was to avoid the confusions created by the rubrics under which scholia minora have been published in the past, such as in "scholastic exercises" (which restricts the text to its transmission context and does not distinguish the scholia minora from other school exercises) and "glossary". . .
