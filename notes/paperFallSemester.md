# Paraphrasing Homer: The Relation between the Psellos Paraphrase and the Commentary Tradition


 The Homeric epics were crucial texts in the education of Greek speakers in antiquity. The importance of the epics led to the prominence and proliferation of glossographic material, including lexica, paraphrases, scholia, and lexical glosses. These texts acted as study aids and references for teachers, students, and general readers of the texts.[^1] The paraphrases present a special branch of this corpus because they attempt not only to define difficult or obscure words, but also to recast the syntax into less complex prose. Debate surrounds the precise nature of the paraphrases, but the predominant opinion holds that they were pre-existing glosses connected into a continuous work.[^2]  Although the coincidence of these lexical glosses, and other parts of the glossographic tradition with the paraphrases, particularly the one attributed to Michael Psellos, is significant and striking,[3] there are serious divergences. The differences suggest that the paraphrases are not just a “review” of the glosses, but, rather, that they hold additions or variations that offer an alternative and valid parallel to the standard collection of glosses. This paper will present a review of past scholarship on the paraphrases and then present examples from the text of the paraphrase to elucidate its argument.
 
 
The texts are commented on by a variety of sources, including grammatical, historical, mythographic, and philological scholia; individual word glosses; and continuous prose paraphrases. As can be seen in the various manuscripts, the scribe put these scholiastic and glossographic materials in different and distinct locations on the page and in relation to the text, as an examination of various manuscripts would demonstrate. These different locations are suggestive of content and source. The mise-en-page cannot be discounted for a purely textual reading. Although these texts are in certain ways distinct, overlap and agreement among them suggest a certain degree of continuity, which begs for a holistic reading.


Scholia and scholiastic material present both a meta-literature and a genre of its own. They exist to comment on pre-existing authors and works, but by their existence they constitute their own style. Within their texts, they preserve ancient scholarship on even older works and present the understanding receive by several generations of critics.[4] Recent scholarship, particularly by Dickey, Montanari, and Nünlist, has worked to elucidate the meaning and style behind the prose of these commentators. Within these contemporary studies, the texts available to ancient scholars have been suggested, and their interests in the works have been revealed.[5]  These studies have also illuminated the variety of sources used and quoted by the ancient critics. Because of the breadth of the corpus, the question of how to read it arises. That is to say, there remains the question of what portions of the vast body of work are to be read with each other and with the text itself. Montanari makes the argument for a contextual reading, “We will define a corpus of scholia as an exegetic corpus variorum, designed to be made up in an orderly way alongside or around the text commented upon.”[6] Scholia that appear together should be read together and not necessarily as separate registers. As Montanari suggests, the ancient critics were working with a particular instantiation of the text, both of the work and of the scholiastic/glossographic material.


Contemporary scholarship on scholia and generally scholiastic material has tended to separate the scholia both from each other and from their context. To some degree, this decision has been a practical one. A scholar can only work on so much, so choices must be made. Access to the primary sources has been limited, so producing a readable text, again, requires certain pieces to be the focus of study. Composite texts of scholia, such as the editions of Hartmut Erbse and Helmut van Thiel, have offered access to texts culled from a spectrum of manuscripts that otherwise would have been inaccessible to all but the most advanced scholars.[7] The traditional approach is not, however, without problem. The approach treats scholia as stable texts, so that spurious material is winnowed out. Because the ultimate point of these texts were as commentaries and reading aids, they were susceptible, more than other texts, to introductions and subtractions, based on the needs and opinions of the scribe. Nonetheless, the manuscripts have not read as artifacts, preserving one compilation of texts. The various groups of scholia are broken up based on modern analyses and classification, without much regard for the tradition of transmission.[8] The separation and re-integration create problems for proper contextual readings. The various materials are integrated on the page of manuscripts, so that they can be read together. Although the volume of text has been prohibitive in achieving this sort of Gesamtwerk, the total reading offers the scholiastic material in their optimal context. 	
Although the commentary material falls into several strains, this paper compares a set of lexical glosses, the definitions given in the Lexicon Homericum of Apollonius Sophistes, and the paraphrase of Michael Psellos.[9] The lexical glosses present some of the oldest commentary on the Iliad, especially in the form of glosses or Worterklärungen.[10]  The last recension of those texts is supposed to have occurred sometime in the tenth century, according to Ernst Maas,[11] so the scholia, as they stand now, comprise a text coming only decades before the paraphrase. The interlinear glosses from the Marciana 454, Allen’s Venetus A, are here as a point of comparison. Because these glosses come from a tenth century manuscript, composed in Constantinople, and represent a compendium of some the most extensive commentary available, it was reasonable to use this as a point of comparison. Because the manuscript’s commentary is so extensive, it would contain the most necessary explanatory notes.[12] The Lexicon of Apollonius Sophistes, which dates from the first century AD.[13] The paraphrase was composed sometime in the eleventh century and is attributed to the Byzantine polymath Michael Psellos.[14]


Although the works of Michael Psellos have been partially published since Leo Allatius’ edition of the Diatriba in 1634, his Homeric paraphrase has never been published in full.[15]  Erwinius Wassenbergh printed an edition in 1783, along his edition of scholia. Following this publication, the much used paraphrase of Immanuel Bekker, based largely on the codex Parisinus 2690, was printed in 1827 as an Appendix to the Scholia in Iliadem.[16] A problem with the 1827 publication, however, is that the Parisian codex had significant gaps which were filled by using other paraphrases that were not necessarily part of the Psellos family.[17] Although Arthur Ludwich noted the issue of Bekker’s paraphrase in his 1883 Aristarchs Textkritik, it still remains the only attempt at a complete text of the Psellos paraphrase. For this paper, a transcription of the Psellos paraphrase created from manuscript Ω.I.12 (Allen’s E4, which is called in the catalogue Escorialensis graecus 513[18]) has be used in place of the standard Bekker paraphrase because, as Spooner notes, Bekker diverges from Psellos.[19] Vassis concurs, “The paraphrase of Rhapsodies B-E of codex stands in no agreement with the Psellos-Paraphrase.”[20]


Ludwich printed around seventy lines from four different paraphrases, the Gaza, Moschopulos, Psellos, and Venetus A, in order to determine their relation.[21] In his analysis, he determined that they all share important commonalities and that the Psellos paraphrase holds the earliest date of composition. While Psellos is the oldest, Ludwich maintains that all four come from a pre-existing body of glosses because ultimately the corpus he reviewed is larger than all the known redactions of the Psellos paraphrase.[22] He proposes further, “they belonged in the past to an older (now lost) forerunning Homer-translation, which the compiler of the scholia vulgata excerpted.”[23] Vassis alternatively suggests that the part of the Bekker paraphrase B-E was “supra-glossed” from D.[24] Spooner suggests that books B-E of Bekker’s paraphrase, which he uses as his text for Psellos, are closer to the D-scholia because they are not part of the Psellos tradition.[25] It is not entirely evident how he arrives at this conclusion because the Psellos paraphrase is remarkably similar to the D-scholia, both in what it glosses and what it lacks. It seems that he does go too far in his differentiation of the two texts. Regardless of Spooner’s conclusion about their similarity, his clear observation that Bekker’s text is a composite, with parts from texts other than that of Psellos, provides reason to base this comparison on a newly prepared text.
The Homeric Lexicon of Apollonius Sophistes serves as the “key source of information on ancient understandings of Homer’s vocabulary and how Homer was read in antiquity.”[26] The main text used is that, again, of Immanuel Bekker from 1833. His edition is based on the single surviving manuscript of the Lexicon, Coislinianus 345, which is in fact an epitome of the text. Various papyri have since been found and published, the largest of which was edited by Albert Henrichs and Wolfgang Müller in 1976. Reference is also made to the lexicon of Hesychius, from the fifth or sixth century, because it preserves some citations and glosses lost elsewhere.[27]


The D-scholia or scholia vulgata, rather than a precisely defined and intentional publication, are a Byzantine compilation that encompasses many forms of Homeric scholia.[28] The chief among them are word glosses and mythological scholia which are taken from various lexica, the so-called glossographoi, and other lexical commentaries. Henrichs determines their defining characteristic to be the “undemanding simplicity of their explanations.”[29] They appear frequently as interlinear glosses, as is seen especially in the Marciana 454, Allen’s Venetus A.[30] The D-scholia have been subject to criticism because they are a less homogenous set than other glossographic materials and because their collection was based in part on a misattribution to Didymus, the first century Homeric scholar and grammarian.[31] Nevertheless, that set of scholia does provide a common and widespread mode of understanding the reception and interpretation of the Homeric epics, especially from the sixth century forward.[32] The last redaction of D “must be placed in the 6th century.”[33] As a result, they were excluded from Hartmut Erbse’s edition of the scholia, but they have been most extensively published by Helmut van Thiel. Wilhelm Dindorf does include them in his edition of the scholia vetera where he names them interlinearia glossemata, interlinear glosses, which occur throughout the Marciana 454. Because of the wide range of sources, including the Marciana 454, from which the scholia minora are drawn, it does not seem unreasonable to use that manuscript as a point of comparison of the extensiveness of the commentary and similarity of provenance to the Psellos paraphrase.


Scholars have found assigning sources to all three of these texts to be challenging. Ioannis Vassis reports from Ludwich that Psellos created his paraphrase from D-scholiastic material,[34] and van der Valk goes further to suggest that the paraphrase is a complete review of the scholia corpus.[35] The contention of this paper is that while the paraphrase draws heavily from the scholia, it is not simply a “review” of them, but it also demonstrates innovation that offers an additional and sometimes alternative source by which to understand the text and its reception. Forsman, the first to pose the question of sources, considered that the chief source for the Lexicon of Apollonius was a gloss collection (Glossensammlung), which was derived from the commentaries of Aristarchus,[36]  but this notion Erbse, based on a chronology of other commentators using similar texts, refutes.[37] Erbse, following Gattiker and others, postulates that the scholia vulgata and the Lexicon both come from a common source under the name of Didymus that existed for a long time before the text of Apollonius.[38] According to van der Valk, Apollonius Sophistes took from Apion, so “the period between the two is too short to assume the intermediary of D. So it is more sensible that D follows Apollonius Sophistes.[39]


A great number of the words are not in fact changed from the original poem to the prose paraphrase. Generally, it appears that only the “unusual poetic words [are translated] into more common ones.”[40] This notion tends to be true, so changes and differences in the glosses prove to be all the more significant. Individual glosses have obvious value, but “the paraphrase remains important because...it [the style of the text] was still much more complex than the Koine, and so it needed explanation.”[41] The continuous paraphrases seek not only to explicate difficult vocabulary, but also to elucidate complex syntactical units. The benefit of the paraphrase is that it gives the context of the word and provides continuity in the progression of the text.
 
 
“The scholia are eclectic compilations from a variety of sources, many of ancient origin, which have been added to and ‘improved’ upon by the Byzantine commentators.”[42] The paraphrase is, then, of an already chimerical nature. The macaronic content is enhanced by the fact that this set of “scholia” is culled largely from a Hellenistic lexicon and then compiled by a Byzantine scholar.

“Even a high-level Byzantine language form can be at best no more than a reflection of how the ancient language was perceived in the Byzantine language community.”[43]

“Thus, as in earlier classicizing literature, there is no direct imitation of classical models and the actual classical usage is not decisive.”[44]

“We may wonder for whom metaphrases were meant. Browning (1978:125) thinks of a common readership for low-register and metaphrastic literature, a readership ‘not educated in the classicizing language.’ Sevcenko (1982:228-9), on the other hand, points out that it is people with the highest education who seem to be reading these texts. He also argues (1982:226-7) for a system of a equivalences common to the new versions of different texts, i.e., an agreement as to what word or phrase should be used to represent a particular word or phrase of the classicizing language. ”[45]

The text of the Lexicon Homericum is straightforward: the edition of Bekker was used. As discussed above, this text was based off of the only extant manuscript of this work of Apollonius, the Coisilianus 345, which is itself an epitome. Although new papyri have been found, none, as far as the author can tell, have anything substantial to add for this particular project. The interlinear glosses are taken directly from photographic images of the Venetus A manuscript and were compared to the edition of Dindorf.[46]


The text of the paraphrase requires a slightly more involved explanation. The two texts used come from the Codex Marcianus 841 and the Escorialensis graecus 513 (Ω.I.12). Transcriptions were made directly from photographic images of the manuscripts.[47] The Escorial manuscript is written in an eleventh century hand,[48] and the Marcianus text comes probably from the fifteenth century.[49] The paraphrases in both of these belong to what Vassis names the “second family” of the paraphrase.[50] Of the eighteen manuscripts deemed important for the reconstruction of the paraphrase text, these two represent major exempla for the second family.[51] Moreover, Ludwich states that he would have liked to have consulted the Ω.I.12 because of its early composition.[52] Ω.I.12 lacks 481; 606, and 607, and the Marciana 841 lacks 481 and 482. All seven hundred forty-six lines of book 15 are present, except for the following. According to Allen, line 15.481 lacks in the vulgate version of the text.[53]  No comment is made about the other lines.


The relationship among the Lexicon, scholia minora, and the paraphrase is evident from their similarity in word usage. Haslam suggests that the scholia minora are frequently connected to particular forms in particular contexts.[54] The lexical entries have also been shown to be aligned with particular usages because they take both form and meaning from the particular quotation. Within the paraphrase, however, the words take the form from its usage in the text. Because the glosses are linked to particular positions, differences among the individual glosses, the Lexicon, and the paraphrase for the same word at the same point offers insight into a parallel and alternative nuance.  Because the Lexicon and interlinear glosses are traditionally linked to their particular location in the text, a close reading of the paraphrase is critical not only for where the other two sources exist, but even more so for where they do not because it proposes the connotation of the word in every line and context.


Ultimately the paraphrase presents the text of the Iliad in prose. Although difficult or uncommon words are glossed in the D-scholia, both the glossed and un-glossed words form part of the prose text. Generally, the order of the line is preserved, and most often the same particles are also maintained.[55] In these cases, the changes to the original vocabulary are minimal, and they are in fact not even noted in the Lexicon or glosses. When one compares the text of the paraphrase to that of the Iliad itself, one sees that the word choice can remain largely the same.
This can be seen, for example, in line one.

15.1 	Iliad: αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ διά τε σκόλοπας καὶ τάφρον ἔβησαν
Paraphrase: ἐπειδὴ δὲ τούς τε σκόλοπας καὶ τὴν τάφρον διέβησαν

It is typical for the articles to be added before the nouns, and it is not uncommon for αὐτάρ to be transformed to δέ.[56] Here, as is frequent, the major content words remain unchanged. Fittingly enough, these lines, too, do not receive glosses in the D-scholia. The predilection to maintain word order and vocabulary does suggest the origin of these texts as reading aids.
In certain instances, the Lexicon defines a single word multiple times with various synonyms. In line 15.2, δάμεν is given in the paraphrase by ἀπέθανον[57] and then in 15.476,  the Homeric δαμασσάμενοί becomes καταπονήσαντες.[58] The Lexicon glosses this Homeric verb at three entries, twice as δεδμήατο and once as δμῶες.[59] The glosses offered are ὑποτεταγμένοι, κατεσκεύαστο; κατεσκευομένοι; and ὑποτετάχθαι. Furthermore, the entry in the Lexicon of Hesychius, which often preserves glosses lost in the Coisilianus epitome, still does not present the Psellos gloss. Earlier in the Marciana 454, ἀνῃρέθησαν, which seems to offer senses of both verbs, is used.[60] The change in the gloss in the paraphrase offers a stronger difference because of the similarity between the rest of the original epic line and the paraphrase. Although they are clearly synonymous, the maintenance of the single gloss throughout the text is suggestive of the conservative nature of the glosses. The stark difference between the two suggests the importance in nuance offered by a reading inclusive of the paraphrases, even and especially where it diverges from the standard gloss of a word or line.


One of the most striking divergences occurs in the different glosses for the various forms of the verb φοβέομαι. This verb gives difficulty because its Homeric meaning is “to flee,” while by the Classical period it means to “to fear.”[61] At all of its appearances in the Marciana 454, it receives a gloss derived from either φεύγω or διώκω.[62] It also receives the phrase εἰς φυγὴν ἐτράπησαν, which appears in the paraphrase at 15.15. The Lexicon as well defines φόβος with φυγῆς.[63] When it appears in the Psellos paraphrase, however, it is defined first ἐκπεπληγμένοι in line 15.4 and then εἰς τὴν φυγὴν ἔτρεψε in line 15.15. At line 15.637, as is common throughout the text of the paraphrase, ἐφοβήθησαν is used as a gloss of ἐφόβηθεν. The word, changed for syntax, is used to gloss itself. This does perhaps suggest the tendency, especially of Apollonius, to fit the archaic word into its contemporary meaning.[64] Because of the partial adherence to the seemingly standard stock of glosses, the use of ἐκπεπληγμένοι at 15.4 offers a different view, which is not supplied elsewhere. Even Hesychius, who offers additions to the Lexicon, offers nothing else.[65] The meaning in the paraphrase here preserves the notion of fright, so it seems that at this particular point it is suggested that the meaning of the verb actually does have its later sense that does appear elsewhere.


In the Marciana 454 book 15, ἐείσατο is glossed twice with the same verb, first as ἐπῆλθεν, then as ἐπῆλθον.[66]  Since they are glossed using the same verb in different contexts, it is evidently the standard gloss and not just a simple indication of one meaning. The paraphrase, in contradistinction, does not use ἔπηλθον, but uses φάνη and ὥρμησαν, respectively, to explicate the Homeric word. Both of these are used elsewhere as interlinear glosses and in particular 1t 2.215. The close correspondence elsewhere throughout the text strongly suggests here that an important alternative understanding exists to a richer comprehension of the text.[67] The Lexicon attests the meaning of ἐφάνη by giving the exemplum from 2.215, “ἀλλ᾽ ὅ τι οἱ εἴσαιτο γελοίϊον Ἀργείοισιν.”[68] The testimony of the Lexicon, taken with other pieces of textual evidence, does suggests that the mutations found in the paraphrase are not entirely invented, but still preserve part of the glossographic tradition from other branches. For Apollonius, ἐείσατο seems to have been an exceptionally difficult word because he offers four separate glosses for the same lexis.


In line 15.104, the paraphrase offers ὀργιζόμεθα in place of μενεαίνομεν. The Marciana 454 present both ὀργιζόμεθα and προθυμούμεθα.[69]  The Lexicon concurs by offering προθυμούμεθα, which is also the gloss offered in the Marciana 454 manuscript in its interlinear gloss.[70] The difference suggests an intentional choice that Psellos made in creating the paraphrase. Although the majority holds one reading, the Venetus A is an exceptionally important text for the preservation of the common text and reading. As a result, it is important to take note of divergences between it and other readings.[71]
Glosses are frequently noted for particular lexical instances, as noted earlier, and, as a result, they tend to maintain a strong attachment to these words. In the case of γνωτόν, in every other discernible instance, it appears with a form of the gloss ἀδελφόν, and this strong connection is maintained even in the Lexicon wherein again the signification of ἀδελφόν is given, even though it cites the passage 15.350, where a significant difference lies in the paraphrase.[72] Hesychius even offers nothing else new for the matter of this word. The paraphrase offers a distinctly vastly different reading of the text, however. Here the text reads συγγενές καὶ συγγενίδες, which clearly presents a more general understanding of the word because this permits for the wider understanding of ἀδελφόν as simply “kinsfolk,” not particularly as brother and then in feminine, sister. Even though the Lexicon cites the passage in 15 as an example of the plural in different genders, only in the paraphrase do both receive a gloss. It is especially significant that this passage is cited because it is the only place in the Iliad where both genders appear together and in the plural.[73]  Further, earlier in the book γνωτόν was indeed glossed as ἀδελφόν, so the connection between the texts is clearly established. The marked change suggests that the composer of the paraphrase understood an additional stratum of text that was not previously present.


Common words, as suggested earlier, provide the opportunity to look comparatively at the usage of glosses. The verb ἀμείβετο appears five times in book 15 alone, and it receives a gloss of some form of either ἀποκρίνω or ἀνταποκρίνω in each instance, except for the last, at which it receives ὑπαλλάσσει.[74] The Lexicon is consonant with this final usage and offers two different glosses, ἀνταποδιδόναι and ἐναλλάσσειν , the latter of which is clearly related to the paraphrase’s gloss closely.[75] The choice here demonstrates the fact that glosses are linked to particular usages because it offers the less frequent meaning of the lexis. As a result, reading the paraphrase together with the other two commentaries is of especial benefit here. If it were not, the more usual sense of a verbal, rather than physical, exchange could be obscured.	
When Arthur Ludwich contended that the D-scholia and paraphrase each represent a branch of an Ur-source, bifurcated around the tenth century,[76] he moved forward the notion of the intimate relation between these commentary texts. This paper has tried to demonstrate that this relation provides more than a continuous replication, but also offers a parallel and sometime alternative understanding of the text.[77] The paraphrase genre arose in order to facilitate the widespread reading of a text that was in a style and language that had become increasingly more challenging.[78] The derivation and genre of the paraphrase necessitated the differences in vocabulary, which represent more closely the nuances in the text. Although the paraphrases represent the longer glossographic tradition, they also form their own literary genre.  They required variation and explication of the text not needed in the lexical reading aids of the scholia. This paraphrase and others like it cannot be undervalued precisely because of their differences from the standard lexical commentaries. These variants give important clarification to distinctions that are lost or obscured in other parts of the glossographic tradition.


Since the paraphrase is meant as a guide, it is important to examine where its text changes that of the *Iliad*. Or, put otherwise, the text of the paraphrase is substantially similar to the text of the epic, so it is telling to see where or how different words are introduced. 

The examination can begin with compound adjectives. The rationale for this lies in the fact that these convey notions often linked directly to the particular text, e.g, stock epithets. 

The first appears at line 15.5,  παρὰ χρυσοθρόνου Ἥρης, which is given as περὶ τῆς χρυσοθρόνον ἐχουσης ἥρας, in the paraphrase. This epithet appears a total of four times in the *Iliad*[^1a]. The question of prepositions aside for the moment[2], the extra participle is inserted while the adjective remains the same. One might speculate that the addition of the participle makes clear that Hera possesses a golden throne, rather than is herself in some way similar to a golden throne. 

The pattern of making the action of the adjective evident continues. In 15.14 one sees first the adjective κακότεχνος, which is translated as κακῶς τέχνασμενος. Rather than Hera being herself craftily-contrived, she in fact *does* the crafty contriving. While this may seem to be too evident to make the distinction, the precision of the translation does suggest that the text does mean (as much as a text can intend to do anything) convey the complete sense of the text. That is, reproducing the sense of the text takes pre-eminence over creating a word-for-word equivalence. Hera is next described as *ἀμήχανε* which the paraphrase gives as κακομηχανή. This is also the gloss which is supplied in the *Lexicon Homericum*. The sense, as the author takes it, differs somewhat from the definition given in Liddell-Scott-Jones, which offers, "against whom or which nothing can be done, irresistible" [3]. The sense, it seems, in the Byzantine text brings out the notion of "evil planning" or "cunningly-wiled," rather than "impossible to plan against." Even still, it avoids the meaning of "plan-less."  


what to make of this?

15.16
κακορραφίης ἀλεγεινῆς

τῆς ἐπὶ μόχθου κακοβουλίας





The change at 15.30 presents a slightly different case. The notion of *ἱππόβοτον*, "horse-grazing" becomes *ἱππότροφον*, "horse-raising." Again, this continues the known trend of directing the action of the adjective to its appropriate agent. The piece of land neither grazing in the manner of cattle nor does it graze on cattle. At the same place a change of noun also occurs. In the epic Zeus asserts that he brought Herakles back to Argos, but in the paraphrase, it is rendered as the Peloponnese. Changes such as this occur elsewhere, in the manner of naming all of the warriors from various regions of Greece "Hellenes."[4] Pindar refers to Argos as *ἱππότροφος* in Nemean Ode 10.41. While the adjective is doubtless fitting, one still needs to wonder about the change of place. Is one to assume that an eleventh century Byzantine reader needed to told that Argos is on the Peloponnese? Perhaps so.

Descriptions of Hera continue to raise questions. At lines 15.34 and 15.49, the goddess is referred to as *βοῶπις πότνια*. In both cases, the paraphrase gives *πότνια* as *σεβασμὶα,* but it gives two different glosses for *βοῶπις*, *μεγαλόφθαλμος* in 15.34 and *εὐόφθαλμε* in 15.49.[5] If one compares the use of *εὐ-* in this instance with its use in others, one can notice that the prefix is sometimes used as intensifier, as in 15.113 *θαλερὼ* as *εὐθαλεῖς* or 15.621 *τροφόεντα* as *εὐτραφῆ*. Or, even, it can replace another intensifying prefix, as in the case of 15.550 *μετέπρεπε* as *εὐτρεπὴς*. The comparanda are not perfect, but they begin to approach the possibilities in meaning. *μεγαλό-* seems natural as a replace for cow-like eye.[6] 

The same word, *μεγαλόφθαλμον*, for *εὐρύοπα* is given at 15.152 when describing the "son of Cronus." The other occurrence of this word at 15.724 the gloss gives *μεγαλόφωνος,* "loud-voiced." The stark difference in meaning is incredibly suggestive. The word, according to the Liddell-Scott-Jones, has a second folk etymology from the Greeks, "Derived by the Greeks from ὄπ-, ὄψομαι, wide-eyed (cf. ἥλιος εὐ. Orph.L.701) or from ὄπ- 'voice' (cf. ϝέπος, ὄψ (A), vox), far-sounding, i.e. thundering (cf. “χορὸς εὐρύοπα κέλαδον φθεγγόμενος” Lyr.Adesp.93, cf. Sch. Il.1.498)".[11] The compiler of the paraphrase is clearly aware of both etymologies and supplies both, at different times. Again, as one sees in the case of the "winged-words," there is a clear awareness of the multivalent character of the diction, and there is an attempt to make those resonances evident. The awareness of the different resonances raises an interesting question about the problem of constructing a gloss in general. In a lexicon, one has the luxury of listing every meaning and as a result one becomes aware all of the possibilities. In a gloss, however, and especially one that tries to remain aligned with the text, one can only present one reading at a time. Evidently this fact is compensated for, to some degree, by the use the multiple different possibilities. 


The variation in translation, as the following example hopes to suggest, may just be that: literary variatio. In translating the phrase *ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα*, the paraphrase gives three possibilities *λόγους ἐπτερωμένους* at 15.35, λόγους ταχεῖς at 15.48,15.145, and 15.157, and a combination of the two, λόγους ταχεῖς καὶ ἐπτερωμένους, at 15.89. What can be made of this? On the one hand, one may speculate that there is a certain discomfort or ill-fit in translating the *πτερόεντα* strictly with *ταχεῖς* because, as no lack of scholarship suggests, the words are more than just swiftly-winged. The cognate, then, becomes the best translation. One, of course, notices that the action of the adjective was transferred onto the noun, the words are flying. In this, both the literal image of the winged, read flying, words is preserved, while still giving *a* sense of the symbol, if not *the* only sense. Then, the usages of the three different forms may indicate the possible literary nature of the text. 

15.50, 15.96, 15.122 *θεοῖς* for  *ἀθανάτοισι*, yet the deathless gods are always deathless gods. 

The translation of *χαλκοχιτώνων* as *σιδηροθωρακῶν* at 15.56 gives a thoroughly intriguing instance of the translation for sense rather than for literal verisimilitude. The Byzantine soldier would not have been wearing bronze armor, and it would have been a breastplate, *θώραξ*, not a shirt, *χιτών*. The change of metal clarifies with a relative level of certainty that a similarity of sense is sought because of the advances and shifts in martial technology. *χαλκοχιτώνων* also occurs at 15.330 in Allen's text, but in the paraphrase the gloss of *καρτεροψύχων* is given, which suggests the text this is based off of had the variant reading given by Allen, *καρτερόθυμος*.[7] This is also the reading in the Omega I.12. It is also worth noting that here *βοιωτῶν* is given for *βοιωτῶν*.[8] 


Oftentimes there are forms that fall out of common usage, and these too are updated. At 15.77, Achilles is described as *πτολίπορθον*, "city-sacking," is transformed in *τὸν τὰς πόλεις πορθοῦντα*. First it is clear that the form of "city" put into the common orthography, and then it is evident that the active adjective is again transformed into a participle with a nominal object. 


The understanding of the body in Homeric verses poses an interesting question. Bruno Snell suggests, based off of the textual and archaeological (vase drawings especially)the understanding, at least artistically, of the human body was of a collection of parts, rather than a totality or a whole.[9] As this understanding changed, it is especially interesting to consider how the choice of glosses reflects this changed in conceptualization. In  15.87 Thetis garners the appellation, *καλλιπαρῄῳ*, "beautiful-cheeked," which is given in the paraphrase as *ἐυπροσώπου*, "beautiful-faced."[10] Here, the part is taken as referential to the whole. It may indeed be the case, but, as in the case of the "ox-eyed" Hera, one comes to consider what it is about these notions of beauty that do not necessarily come across literally, but notionally. 



15.135 ὑπερθύμους as μεγαλοψύχους. 
καρτερόθυμος as καρτεροψύχων

15.161 ἅλα δῖαν as μεγάλην θάλασσαν
also at 15.177, 15.223. This is interesting because other uses of the adjective garner translation like ἔνδοξος, when describing a person.

An interesting development in the world of bronze. 
15.221 πολεμικὸν for χαλκοκορυστήν
15.458 εὐοπλω 
Again, these do suggest that the sense of the word and what action it conveys are of greater importance than literal exactitude. When Hector, for they both times describe the great tamer of horses, possesses the brazen arms, he is warlike and well-equipped. Then again he is εὔοπλος when he possesses the κορυθαίολος. 


15.253 τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπεν ἄναξ ἑκάεργος Ἀπόλλων

πρὸς τοῦτον δὲ πάλιν εἶπεν ὁ τοῦ διὸς υἱὸς βασιλεὺς ἀπόλλων

15.262 τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν ὄχλων
both anax and poimen give basileus.

[2]: The placement of genitives proves to be interesting. Usually genitives proceed after their attendant noun, in the fashion "article, adjective, noun," but in some cases there is some attribution to the noun. In the case of 15.5, this may be to signify that Hera *possesses* the chair, rather that presently *performs* the act of holding it.

[6]: There is an essay somewhere that exhorts readers of Homer to take seriously the fact they people are described using cattle adjectives. Was there then something "attractive" about wide-eyed cows? Does it signify health, fertility, vivacity? All the same, she is large-eyed and "well-eyed."

A majority of the particles remains constant through the text. This reflects the consistency, or perceived continuity, of particles. This continuity may also reflect the tendency of the grammarians to maintain the meaning of words as much as possible. Even still, the number of changes in the particles does indicate the general awareness that the meaning of the words, in particular certain particles, does change.
An obvious change is the disappearance of γέ throughout the text.[79]
Sophocles’ Lexicon (1870)
δέ – strengthening particle after relatives (347).
ἐπειδάν – with aor. indic. Or aor. opt. 2) Because = διότι with the indicative
 (494).
ἐπειδή = διότι since, because
The distinguishing difference between the Psellos paraphrase, or any paraphrase for that matter, and typical interlinear glosses is the connected nature of the text. Glosses become prose not only by the fullness of text, but also by the presence of particles that connect the text into coherent ideas. The text of Psellos paraphrase offers a remarkable level of retention of the Homeric particles. There are of course changes. These will be noted in this part of the paper.
The particle δέ often signifies itself in the paraphrase, but in other instances it represents several other contrastive particles. From the very first line, one sees that it signifies the conjunction αὐτάρ. So too in line 45, 113, 134, 147, 241 (ατάρ), .
 
“The change of sense from “except (that)” to “but” is most apparent where πλήν is construed with a finite verb or where we feel that a finite verb must be supplied.”[80] Classical usage introduces an exception, while Hellenistic usage has it as an adversative or progressive particle.
Λοιπόν is an inferential or progressive particle that still retains its Classical functional of a temporal adverb.[81] Emphatic particles, on the other hand, become less common in Hellenistic prose, but I am not prepared to call that process simply a decline.[82]

[5]: Montanari viii, What is thereby highlighted is the central importance of the relation between the library artefact and the text as an object of editing, that is to say, between on the one hand the craftsman's practices, aimed at correcting, in a copy, that which was held to be wrong (often by means of comparison with the antigraph or with other copies), and on the other hand, the rise of a philological practice seeking to emend the text of a work, in which case it was the text itself that was held to be unsatisfactory due to errors that had crept in over time and had been handed down through tradition. Finally, the framework thus reconstructed allows reflection on the nature of the readings attributed to the Alexandrian grammarians.
