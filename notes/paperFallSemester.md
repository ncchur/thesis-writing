Paraphrasing Homer: The Relation between the Psellos Paraphrase and the Commentary Tradition

Greek students learned their alphabet from the Homeric epics, but the vocabulary of the epics were defined and, as a result, learned elsewhere. The importance of the Homeric epics in the education of Greek speakers led to the prominence and proliferation of glossographic material, including lexica, paraphrases, scholia, and lexical glosses. These texts acted as study aids and references for teachers, students, and general readers of the texts.[1] The paraphrases present a special branch of this corpus because they attempt not only to define difficult or obscure words, but also to recast the syntax into less complex prose. Debate surrounds the precise nature of the paraphrases, but the predominant opinion proposes that they were pre-existing glosses connected into a continuous work.[2]  Although the coincidence of these lexical glosses, and other parts of the glossographic tradition with the paraphrases, particularly the one attributed to Michael Psellos, is significant and striking,[3] there are serious divergences. The differences suggest that the paraphrases are just a “review” of the glosses, but, rather, that there were additions or variations that offer an alternative and valid to parallel to the standard collection of glosses.

The texts are commented on by a variety of sources, including grammatical, historical, mythographic, and philological scholia; individual word glosses; and continuous prose paraphrases. As can be seen in the various manuscripts, the scribe put these scholiastic and glossographic materials in different and distinct locations on the page and in relation to the text, as an examination of various manuscripts would demonstrate. These different locations are suggestive of content and source. The mise-en-page cannot be discounted for a purely textual reading. Although these texts are in certain ways distinct, overlap and agreement among them suggest a certain degree of continuity, which begs for a holistic reading.

Scholia and scholiastic material present both a meta-literature and a genre of its own. They exist to comment on pre-existing authors and works, but by their existence they constitute their own style. Within their texts, they preserve ancient scholarship on even older works and present the understanding receive by several generations of critics.[4] Recent scholarship, particularly by Dickey, Montanari, and Nünlist, has worked to elucidate the meaning and style behind the prose of these commentators. Within these contemporary studies, the texts available to ancient scholars have been suggested, and their interests in the works have been revealed.[5]  These studies have also illuminated the variety of sources used and quoted by the ancient critics. Because of the breadth of the corpus, the question of how to read it arises. That is to say, there remains the question of what portions of the vast body of work are to be read with each other and with the text itself. Montanari makes the argument for a contextual reading, “We will define a corpus of scholia as an exegetic corpus variorum, designed to be made up in an orderly way alongside or around the text commented upon.”[6] Scholia that appear together should be read together and not necessarily as separate registers. As Montanari suggests, the ancient critics were working with a particular instantiation of the text, both of the work and of the scholiastic/glossographic material.
 
            Contemporary scholarship on scholia and generally scholiastic material has tended to separate the scholia both from each other and from their context. To some degree, this decision has been a practical one. A scholar can only work on so much, so choices must be made. Access to the primary sources has been limited, so producing a readable text, again, requires certain pieces to be the focus of study. Composite texts of scholia, such as the editions of Hartmut Erbse and Helmut van Thiel, have offered access to texts culled from a spectrum of manuscripts that otherwise would have been inaccessible to all but the most advanced scholars.[7] The traditional approach is not, however, without problem. The approach treats scholia as stable texts, so that spurious material is winnowed out. Because the ultimate point of these texts were as commentaries and reading aids, they were susceptible, more than other texts, to introductions and subtractions, based on the needs and opinions of the scribe. Nonetheless, the manuscripts have not read as artifacts, preserving one compilation of texts. The various groups of scholia are broken up based on modern analyses and classification, without much regard for the tradition of transmission.[8] The separation and re-integration create problems for proper contextual readings. The various materials are integrated on the page of manuscripts, so that they can be read together. Although the volume of text has been prohibitive in achieving this sort of Gesamtwerk, the total reading offers the scholiastic material in their optimal context.    

Although the commentary material falls into several strains, this paper compares a set of lexical glosses, the definitions given in the Lexicon Homericum of Apollonius Sophistes, and the paraphrase of Michael Psellos.[9] The lexical glosses present some of the oldest commentary on the Iliad, especially in the form of glosses or Worterklärungen.[10]  The last recension of those texts is supposed to have occurred sometime in the tenth century, according to Ernst Maas,[11] so the scholia, as they stand now, comprise a text coming only decades before the paraphrase. The interlinear glosses from the Marciana 454, Allen’s Venetus A, are here as a point of comparison. Because these glosses come from a tenth century manuscript, composed in Constantinople, and represent a compendium of some the most extensive commentary available, it was reasonable to use this as a point of comparison. Because the manuscript’s commentary is so extensive, it would contain the most necessary explanatory notes.[12] The Lexicon of Apollonius Sophistes, which dates from the first century AD.[13] The paraphrase was composed sometime in the eleventh century and is attributed to the Byzantine polymath Michael Psellos.[14]

Although the works of Michael Psellos have been partially published since Leo Allatius’ edition of the Diatriba in 1634, his Homeric paraphrase has never been published in full.[15]  Erwinius Wassenbergh printed an edition in 1783, along his edition of scholia. Following this publication, the much used paraphrase of Immanuel Bekker, based largely on the codex Parisinus 2690, was printed in 1827 as an Appendix to the Scholia in Iliadem.[16] A problem with the 1827 publication, however, is that the Parisian codex had significant gaps which were filled by using other paraphrases that were not necessarily part of the Psellos family.[17] Although Arthur Ludwich noted the issue of Bekker’s paraphrase in his 1883 Aristarchs Textkritik, it still remains the only attempt at a complete text of the Psellos paraphrase. For this paper, a transcription of the Psellos paraphrase created from manuscript Ω.I.12 (Allen’s E4, which is called in the catalogue Escorialensis graecus 513[18]) has be used in place of the standard Bekker paraphrase because, as Spooner notes, Bekker diverges from Psellos.[19] Vassis concurs, “The paraphrase of Rhapsodies B-E of codex stands in no agreement with the Psellos-Paraphrase.”[20]

Ludwich printed around seventy lines from four different paraphrases, the Gaza, Moschopulos, Psellos, and Venetus A, in order to determine their relation.[21] In his analysis, he determined that they all share important commonalities and that the Psellos paraphrase holds the earliest date of composition. While Psellos is the oldest, Ludwich maintains that all four come from a pre-existing body of glosses because ultimately the corpus he reviewed is larger than all the known redactions of the Psellos paraphrase.[22] He proposes further, “they belonged in the past to an older (now lost) forerunning Homer-translation, which the compiler of the scholia vulgata excerpted.”[23] Vassis alternatively suggests that the part of the Bekker paraphrase B-E was “supra-glossed” from D.[24] Spooner suggests that books B-E of Bekker’s paraphrase, which he uses as his text for Psellos, are closer to the D-scholia because they are not part of the Psellos tradition.[25] It is not entirely evident how he arrives at this conclusion because the Psellos paraphrase is remarkably similar to the D-scholia, both in what it glosses and what it lacks. It seems that he does go too far in his differentiation of the two texts. Regardless of Spooner’s conclusion about their similarity, his clear observation that Bekker’s text is a composite, with parts from texts other than that of Psellos, provides reason to base this comparison on a newly prepared text.

The Homeric Lexicon of Apollonius Sophistes serves as the “key source of information on ancient understandings of Homer’s vocabulary and how Homer was read in antiquity.”[26] The main text used is that, again, of Immanuel Bekker from 1833. His edition is based on the single surviving manuscript of the Lexicon, Coislinianus 345, which is in fact an epitome of the text. Various papyri have since been found and published, the largest of which was edited by Albert Henrichs and Wolfgang Müller in 1976. Reference is also made to the lexicon of Hesychius, from the fifth or sixth century, because it preserves some citations and glosses lost elsewhere.[27]

The D-scholia or scholia vulgata, rather than a precisely defined and intentional publication, are a Byzantine compilation that encompasses many forms of Homeric scholia.[28] The chief among them are word glosses and mythological scholia which are taken from various lexica, the so-called glossographoi, and other lexical commentaries. Henrichs determines their defining characteristic to be the “undemanding simplicity of their explanations.”[29] They appear frequently as interlinear glosses, as is seen especially in the Marciana 454, Allen’s Venetus A.[30] The D-scholia have been subject to criticism because they are a less homogenous set than other glossographic materials and because their collection was based in part on a misattribution to Didymus, the first century Homeric scholar and grammarian.[31] Nevertheless, that set of scholia does provide a common and widespread mode of understanding the reception and interpretation of the Homeric epics, especially from the sixth century forward.[32] As a result, they were excluded from Hartmut Erbse’s edition of the scholia, but they have been most extensively published by Helmut van Thiel. Wilhelm Dindorf does include them in his edition of the scholia vetera where he names them interlinearia glossemata, interlinear glosses, which occur throughout the Marciana 454. Because of the wide range of sources, including the Marciana 454, from which the scholia minora are drawn, it does not seem unreasonable to use that manuscript as a point of comparison of the extensiveness of the commentary and similarity of provenance to the Psellos paraphrase.

Scholars have found assigning sources to all three of these texts to be challenging. Ioannis Vassis reports from Ludwich that Psellos created his paraphrase from D-scholiastic material,[33] and van der Valk goes further to suggest that the paraphrase is a complete review of the scholia corpus.[34] The contention of this paper is that while the paraphrase draws heavily from the scholia, it is not simply a “review” of them, but it also demonstrates innovation that offers an additional and sometimes alternative source by which to understand the text and its reception. Forsman, the first to pose the question of sources, considered that the chief source for the Lexicon of Apollonius was a gloss collection (Glossensammlung), which was derived from the commentaries of Aristarchus,[35]  but this notion Erbse, based on a chronology of other commentators using similar texts, refutes.[36] Erbse, following Gattiker and others, postulates that the scholia vulgata and the Lexicon both come from a common source under the name of Didymus that existed for a long time before the text of Apollonius.[37]

A great number of the words are not in fact changed from the original poem to the prose paraphrase. Generally, it appears that only the “unusual poetic words [are translated] into more common ones.”[38] This notion tends to be true, so changes and differences in the glosses prove to be all the more significant. Individual glosses have obvious value, but “the paraphrase remains important because...it [the style of the text] was still much more complex than the Koine, and so it needed explanation.”[39] The continuous paraphrases seek not only to explicate difficult vocabulary, but also to elucidate complex syntactical units. The benefit of the paraphrase is that it gives the context of the word and provides continuity in the progression of the text.

The relationship among the Lexicon, scholia minora, and the paraphrase is evident. Haslam suggests that the scholia minora are frequently connected to particular forms in particular contexts.[40] The lexical entries have also been shown to be aligned with particular usages because they take both form and meaning from the particular quotation. Within the paraphrase, however, the words take the form from its usage in the text. Because the glosses are linked to particular positions, differences among the individual glosses, the Lexicon, and the paraphrase for the same word at the same point offers insight into a parallel and alternative nuance. 

Ultimately the paraphrase presents the text of the Iliad in prose. Although difficult or uncommon words are glossed in the D-scholia, both the glossed and un-glossed words form part of the prose text. Generally, the order of the line is preserved, and most often the same particles are also maintained.[41] In these cases, the changes to the original vocabulary are minimal, and they are in fact not even noted in the Lexicon or glosses. When one compares the text of the paraphrase to that of the Iliad itself, one sees that the word choice can remain largely the same.
This can be seen, for example, in line one.

15.1     Iliad: αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ διά τε σκόλοπας καὶ τάφρον ἔβησαν

            Paraphrase: ἐπειδὴ δὲ τούς τε σκόλοπας καὶ τὴν τάφρον διέβησαν

It is typical for the articles to be added before the nouns, and it is not uncommon for αὐτάρ to be transformed to δέ.[42] Here, as is frequent, the major content words remain unchanged. Fittingly enough, these lines, too, do not receive glosses in the D-scholia. The predilection to maintain word order and vocabulary does suggest the origin of these texts as reading aids.

In certain instances, the Lexicon defines a single word multiple times with various synonyms. In line 15.2, δάμεν is given in the paraphrase by ἀπέθανον[43] and then in 15.476,  the Homeric δαμασσάμενοί becomes καταπονήσαντες.[44] The Lexicon glosses this Homeric verb at three entries, twice as δεδμήατο and once as δμῶες.[45] The glosses offered are ὑποτεταγμένοι, κατεσκεύαστο; κατεσκευομένοι; and ὑποτετάχθαι. Furthermore, the entry in the Lexicon of Hesychius, which often preserves glosses lost in the Coisilianus epitome, still does not present the Psellos gloss. Earlier in the Marciana 454, ἀνῃρέθησαν, which seems to offer senses of both verbs, is used.[46] The change in the gloss in the paraphrase offers a stronger difference because of the similarity between the rest of the original epic line and the paraphrase. Although they are clearly synonymous, the maintenance of the single gloss throughout the text is suggestive of the conservative nature of the glosses. The stark difference between the two suggests the importance in nuance offered by a reading inclusive of the paraphrases, even and especially where it diverges from the standard gloss of a word or line.

One of the most striking divergences occurs in the different glosses for the various forms of the verb φοβέομαι. This verb gives difficulty because its Homeric meaning is “to flee,” while by the Classical period it means to “to fear.”[47] When it appears in the Psellos paraphrase, however, it is defined first ἐκπεπληγμένοι in line 15.4 and then εἰς τὴν φυγὴν ἔτρεψε in line 15.15. Apollonius Sophistes offers no new or different definition, and even Hesychius, who offers additions to the Lexicon, offers nothing else.[48] As is common throughout the text of the paraphrase, in line 15.637, ἐφοβήθησαν is used as a gloss of ἐφόβηθεν. The word, changed for syntax is used to gloss itself. This does perhaps suggest the indicated tendency, especially of Apollonius, to try to fit the archaic word into its contemporary meaning.[49]

At all of its appearances, it receives a gloss derived from either φεύγω or διώκω.[50] It also receives the phrase εἰς φυγὴν ἐτράπησαν, which appears in the paraphrase at 15.15. The Lexicon as well defines φόβος with φυγῆς.[51] Because of the partial adherence to the seemingly standard stock of glosses, the use of ἐκπεπληγμένοι at 15.4 offers a different view, which is not supplied elsewhere. The meaning here preserves the notion of fright, so it seems that at this particular point it is suggested the meaning of the verb has the later sense that is not maintained elsewhere. The retention elsewhere of the typical gloss may suggest that word maintained and expanded its semantic range.

In the Marciana 454 book 15, ἐείσατο is glossed twice with the same verb, first as ἐπῆλθεν, then as ἐπῆλθον.[52]  Since they are glossed using the same verb in different contexts, it is evidently the standard gloss and not just a simple indication of one meaning. The paraphrase, in contradistinction, does not use ἔπηλθον, and, moreover, uses φάνη and ὥρμησαν, respectively, to explicate the Homeric word. The Lexicon attests the meaning of ἐφάνη by giving the exemplum from 2.215, “ἀλλ᾽ ὅ τι οἱ εἴσαιτο γελοίϊον Ἀργείοισιν.”[53] The testimony of the Lexicon, taken with other pieces of textual evidence, does suggests that the mutations found in the paraphrase are not entirely invented, but still preserve part of the glossographic tradition from other branches. For Apollonius, ἐείσατο seems to have been an exceptionally difficult word because he offers four separate glosses for the same lexis.

The paraphrase supplies two different verbs φάνη and ὥρμησαν, respectively, to explicate the Homeric word. Both of these are used elsewhere as interlinear glosses. The Lexicon, too, suggests ἐφάνη by citing an exemplum from 2.215, which receives the same gloss in the Marciana 454. The close correspondence elsewhere throughout the text strongly suggests here that an important alternative understanding exists to a richer comprehension of the text.[54]

In line 15.104, the paraphrase offers ὀργιζόμεθα in place of μενεαίνομεν. The Marciana 454 present both ὀργιζόμεθα and προθυμούμεθα.[55]  The Lexicon concurs by offering προθυμούμεθα, which is also the gloss offered in the Marciana 454 manuscript in its interlinear gloss.[56] The difference suggests an intentional choice that Psellos made in creating the paraphrase. Although the majority holds one reading, the Venetus A is an exceptionally important text for the preservation of the common text and reading. As a result, it is important to take note of divergences between it and other readings.[57]

Glosses are frequently noted for particular lexical instances, as noted earlier, and, as a result, they tend to maintain a strong attachment to these words. In the case of γνωτόν, in every other discernible instance, it appears with a form of the gloss ἀδελφόν, and this strong connection is maintained even in the Lexicon wherein again the signification of ἀδελφόν is given, even though it cites the passage 15.350, where a significant difference lies in the paraphrase.[58] Hesychius even offers nothing else new for the matter of this word. The paraphrase offers a distinctly vastly different reading of the text, however. Here the text reads συγγενές καὶ συγγενίδες, which clearly presents a more general understanding of the word because this permits for the wider understanding of ἀδελφόν as simply “kinsfolk,” not particularly as brother and then in feminine, sister. Even though the Lexicon cites the passage in 15 as an example of the plural in different genders, only in the paraphrase do both receive a gloss. It is especially significant that this passage is cited because it is the only place in the Iliad where both genders appear together and in the plural.[59]  Further, earlier in the book γνωτόν was indeed glossed as ἀδελφόν, so the connection between the texts is clearly established. The marked change suggests that the composer of the paraphrase understood an additional stratum of text that was not previously present.

Common words, as suggested earlier, provide the opportunity to look comparatively at usage of glosses. The verb ἀμείβετο appears five times in book 15 alone, and it receives a gloss of some form of either ἀποκρίνω or ἀνταποκρίνω in each instance, except for the last, at which it receives ὑπαλλάσσει. The Lexicon is consonant with this final usage and offers two different glosses, ἀνταποδιδόναι and ἐναλλάσσειν , the latter of which is clearly related to the paraphrase’s gloss closely.[60] The choice here demonstrates the fact that glosses are linked to particular usages because it offers the less frequent meaning of the lexis. As a result, reading the paraphrase together with the other two commentaries is of especial benefit here. If it were not, the more usual sense of a verbal, rather than physical, exchange would be obscured.  

Because the Lexicon and interlinear glosses are traditionally linked to their particular location in the text, a close reading of the paraphrase is critical not only for where they do exist, but even more so where they do not because there no other source to propose the connotation of the word in the line and context.

When Arthur Ludwich contended that the D-scholia and paraphrase each represent a branch of an Ur-source bifurcated around the tenth century,[61] he moved forward the notion of the intimate relation between these commentary texts. The attempt has been made to demonstrate that this relation, while existent, provides more than a continuous replication, but also offers an alternative and parallel understanding of the text.[62] The derivation and genre of the paraphrase necessitated the differences in vocabulary, which represent the nuances in the text. The paraphrase genre arose in order to facilitate the widespread reading of a text that was in a style and language that had become increasing more challenging.[63] Although the paraphrases represented the longer glossographic and commentary tradition, they became their own literary genre.  They required variation and explication of the text not needed before in the reading aids of the scholia. This paraphrase and others like it cannot be undervalued precisely because of their differences from the standard lexical commentaries. They give important clarification to nuances that are lost or obscured in other parts of the glossographic tradition.
