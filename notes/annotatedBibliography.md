Bekker, Immanuel. Scholiorum in Homeri Iliadem Appendix. Berlin: Reimer, 1827.
>-Edition of paraphrase, based chiefly on a manuscript of the Psellos paraphrase, but with notable additions, e.g., catalogue of ships, from other manuscripts and Wassenbergh’s paraphrase.
Dickey, Eleanor. Ancient Greek Scholarship. Oxford: University Press, 2007.
	>-Presents and discusses ancient scholarship and modern scholarship on it. Important synthesis of the past two centuries (at least) of criticism.
Erbse, Hartmut. Beiträge zum Ueberlieferung der Iliasscholien. Munich: Beck, 1960.
	>-Useful for its section on sources for the scholia, especially the one on Apollonius Sophistes. Erbse presents past opinions on the connection of the Homeric Lexicon to the scholia and his own conclusions. Erbse concludes that there was an ur-source for the Lexicon and scholia, but later there were more new introductions from the Lexicon to the scholia.
Gattiker, Hans. Das Verhältnis des Homerlexikons des Apollonios Sophistes zu den Homerscholien. Zurich: 	Leeman & co., 1945.
	>-Gattiker gives a strongly philological argument for the connection between the Lexicon and the scholia, specifically the D-scholia. This study is especially important because he integrates some papyrological evidence not used by or available to Bekker in his edition of the Lexicon.

	>-These three studies, and especially the first two, offer a good review of earlier scholarship and Haslam’s arguments on the life of the Lexicon. He discusses new finds in papyri (such as his 1982 ZPE article).

Ludwich, Arthur. Aristarchs Homerische Textkritik. Aristarchs homerische Textkritik nach den 	Fragmenten des 	Didymos. Leipzig: Teubner, 1884.
	>-Ludwich examines closely the major paraphrases of the Iliad and proposes the relationship among them. He also prints significant portions of some these paraphrases, and his printing, as small as it is, constitutes the only printing of them.
