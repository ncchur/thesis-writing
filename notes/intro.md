# Paraphrasing Homer: The Relation between the Psellos Paraphrase and the Commentary Tradition


## Introduction ##


 The Homeric epics were crucial texts in the education of Greek speakers in antiquity. The importance of the epics led to the prominence and proliferation of glossographic material, including lexica, paraphrases, scholia, and lexical glosses. These texts acted as study aids and references for teachers, students, and general readers of the texts.[^intro1] The paraphrases present a special branch of this corpus because they attempt not only to define difficult or obscure words, but also to recast the syntax into less complex prose. Debate surrounds the precise nature of the paraphrases, but the predominant opinion holds that they were pre-existing glosses connected into a continuous work.[^intro2]  Although the coincidence of these lexical glosses, and other parts of the glossographic tradition with the paraphrases, particularly the one attributed to Michael Psellos, is significant and striking,[^intro3] there are serious divergences. The differences suggest that the paraphrases are not just a “review” of the glosses, but, rather, that they hold additions or variations that offer an alternative and valid parallel to the standard collection of glosses. This paper will present a review of past scholarship on the paraphrases and then present examples from the text of the paraphrase *to elucidate its argument*.
