The Iliadic texts are commented on by a variety of sources, including grammatical, historical, mythographic, and philological scholia; individual word glosses; and continuous prose paraphrases. As can be seen in the various manuscripts, the scribe put these scholiastic and glossographic materials in different and distinct locations on the page and in relation to the text, as an examination of various manuscripts would demonstrate. These different locations are suggestive of content and source. The mise-en-page cannot be discounted for a purely textual reading. Although these texts are in certain ways distinct, overlap and agreement among them suggest a certain degree of continuity, which begs for a holistic reading.

> Need to expand the preceding paragraph with concrete examples

Scholia and scholiastic material present both a meta-literature and a genre of their own. They exist to comment on pre-existing authors and works, but by their existence they constitute their own style. Within their texts, they preserve ancient scholarship on even older works and present the understanding received by several generations of critics.[^4]
