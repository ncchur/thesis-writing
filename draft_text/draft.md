# Introduction

The finish of this paper is not yet certain, but the process and general goal are to compare Byzantine paraphrases of the Iliad, particularly books 1 and 15, among each other and with the interlinear glosses from the Marciana 454 and to discern connections or relationships among them. The manuscripts to be investigated are Marciana 454, Marciana 841, Escorial Ω.I.12, and Genavensis 44. The Marciana 454’s paraphrase is distinct but has strinking similarities to Bekker's paraphrase (still need to do comparison with Psellos'), and the other three contain the so-called Psellos paraphrase. Psellos’ paraphrase pre-dates that of the Marciana 454 by approximately four hundred years. 




# Discussion of Manuscripts	


## Marciana 454
The Marciana 454, also referred to as the Venetus A, contains an interlinear paraphrase throughout book 1 and the approximately first third of book 2, which becomes more fragmentary after 1.175. This paraphrase is distinct among the other manuscripts being considered, but shares common features with the paraphrases of Psellos and Theodorus Gaza, as indicated by the comparison conducted by Ludwich (cf. Ludwich 513-515) (see table A for break-down of scripts of paraphrase.). As Ludwich observes, the hand of the paraphrase is younger than that of the main text (“jüngerer Hand (15. Jahrh.?), eine Interlinearparaphrase (darüber schweigt W. Dindorf in seiner Vorrede zu den Ilias-Scholien), die den oben besprcohenen nicht unwesentlich abweicht,“ Ludwich 493). Ludiwch observes the similarities among the "content words," but a comparison with Bekker's paraphrase shows an extensive similarity. Bekker did consult the 454 for his edition of the scholia in Iliadem, so he would have been at least familiar with the manuscript. Although it seems, according to certain footnotes in Bekker and the reference of Ludwich, that the text of Bekker's paraphrase derived mainly from the Paris. reg. manuscript, there is an undeniable similarity. According to Ioannis Vassis, "die [Paraphrase] von Immanuel Bekker als Appendix zu seiner Edition der Scholien zur Ilias (Bekker 1827) präsentierte Paraphrase des cod. Paris. gr. 2690, die größenteils der Psellos-Paraphrase angehört, bilden schließlich bis heute die einzigen vollständigen Ausgaben einer von Α bis Ω reichenden Ilias-Paraphrase" (Vassis 2), so the paraphrase of the Paris. gr. 2690 is related to that of Psellos, and indeed Vassis cites it fifth in his work with the siglum "b" .

## Marciana 841
 

The Marciana 841 begins in book 14, with 15 as the first complete book. MS 841 presents the text of the poem and the paraphrase by the half-line (hemistich). From a small sampling, one sees that the lines are cut without obvious consideration for the semantic content. This is not to say that the separation is arbitrary or without reason, but rather that the half-line demarcations appear to be based more on a syllabic or metrical basis than on a semantic one (see table B for cursory line-by-line analysis). The line split occurs most frequently in the third, and less often the fourth, foot.  
	


## Escorial Ω.I.12
The Escorial Ω.I.12 presents the same paraphrase family in parallel with full lines. 
	


# Comparisons

Based on the coincidence of the Psellos paraphrase and the scholia vulgata, Ludwich posits that the two come from an Ur-source, so that they represent divergent strains from the same family („Das Resultat kann nicht zweitehalt sein: an einer auffallend großen Anzahl von Stellen decken sich die Paraphrasen genau mit den Scholia vulg., am auffälligsten die Psellos-Paraphrase, die sogar das von den anderen Uebersetzern verschämhte /kaka// für /a)/legea/...uzw“ (Luwdich 515). Only Psellos is older than Schol. Vulg.; the others are definitely later. Scholia vulgata and Psellos might share “Q,” Ludwich 516). Spooner concurs, in some sense, with this point, “The continuous grammatical paraphrases on papyrus and tablets published to date match, not surprisingly, the scholia minora and D in their choice of vocabulary” (Spooner 23).

A comparison between the Bekker paraphrase and that of the Marciana 454 suggests similarities with consistent differences (see table c). (Vassis 12, Der Archetypos der Handschriften der Psellos-Paraphrase ist anderseits spätestens ins 11. Jh. zu setzen. Daß diese Paraphrase etwa eine gemeinsame Quelle mit den D-Scholien)

# Comparison of Psellos Paraphrase from Escorial Ω.I.12 with the text of the Iliad in book 15


The article is used more often in the paraphrase than in the text of the poem. Further, when the pronouns τόν and μιν are used in the text, αὐτόν is used in the paraphrase. When Danaans, Achaeans, and Argives are mentioned in the text, Hellenes is used almost universally in the parphrase. The particles generally remain the same; the continuity is interesting, especially because there is a two thousand year gap in the composition of the texts.

# On using the terms scholia minora and uulgata
The terms scholia minora, scholia vulgata, and D scholia are all used by various scholars to define and label certain groups of scholia that comment on the text of the Iliad text found in the mansucripts. While the terms have their uses, to be sure, in this paper the term "interlinear glosses" will be used to refer to a group of scholia which are both also used with the vulgata and minora appellations. The use of the term interlinear glosses is not without precedent: Wilhelm Dindorf deems this group, more or less, "glossemata interlinearea" in his edition of scholia.
Spooner 3, The use of the designation "scholia minora" was to avoid the confusions created by the rubrics under which scholia minora have been published in the past, such as in "scholastic exercises" (which restricts the text to its transmission context and does not distinguish the scholia minora from other school exercises) and "glossary". . . 

The lexicon of Apollonius Sophistes is certainly related to the scholia minora, but disagreement about the direction remains. While most scholars believe that the so-called D-Scholia were the source for the lexicon, some, including van der Valk, believe the reverse to be true (Haslam Composition 1).

An important note on the lexicon: The quotations are often absent from the Coislinianus, but consistently are preserved in an early papyrus (P. Bodl. Lib. Ms. gr. class. e. 44) (Haslam Composition 29 n. 86).

Sophistes is fond of suggesting that the Homeric word bears its present meaning (Haslam Composition 29).

Thanks to papyri, we have the numerous examples of the kind of word-by-word glossing that goes under that anachronistic label (Haslam Composition 40).

"Forsman . . . postulierte als Hauptvorlage eine Glossensammlung, die aus den Kommentaren Aristarchs exzepeirt worden sei" (Erbse Beiträge 407).

# General Introudctory material
	
	Paul Moore, in his Iter Psellianum, cites 1176 works in the corpus psellianum (Moore 9). Some of these works are published variously in the Patrologia Graeca, Bibliotheca Teubneriana, and various other publications. From 1634 with the publication of Leo Allatius’ Diatriba to the present the day, all of the works of Psellos have not been published, and even those that have been have not all been published in full. This paper focuses mainly on the paraphrase of the Iliad. This work has been published in part and in sort by Wassenbergh and Bekker. Studies have been done on the text by Ludwich. The manuscripts have been collected and discussed by Ioannis Vassis. The point of this paper will be to investigate and discuss the connection between the so-called “D-scholia,” the Homeric Lexicon of Apollonius Sophistes, and the paraphrase of Psellos, particularly in book 15 of the Iliad and with reference to the early sections of book 1. To this end, editions of the text from these two books from the Omega 1.12 and Marciana 841 manuscripts will be made. 
	
	It is clear, based on previous scholarship, that there is a relationship between the D-scholia and the paraphrase. Vassis reports from Ludwich that Psellos created his paraphrase from D-scholiastic material (Er hält es für wahrscheinlicher, daß Psellos aus den D-Scholien geschöpft hat, von welchen er wiederum vermutete, daß sie aus der Auflösung einer fortlaufenden, uns nicht erhaltenen Paraphrase stammen, als daß Paraphrase und Scholien auf eine gemeinsame Quelle zurückgehen). Vassis contends, however, that the D-Scholia are a “byzantine compilation, of which the chief sources are Homeric glosses, lexica, and Hellenistic paraphrases.” Van der Valk suggests that the paraphrase is a complete review of the scholia corpus (Vassis 11-12).
	
	Forsman, the first to pose the question of sources, considered that the chief source for the Lexicon of Apollonius was a Gloss collection (Glossensammlung), which was derived from the commentaries of Aristarchus (Erbse 407). This notion Erbse, based on a chronology of other commentators using similar texts, refutes (Erbse 408). Gattiker, in Erbse’s view, takes a more correct position by postulating that the “scholia vulgata” are contained in a text under the name of Didymus that existed for a long time before the text of Apollonius. The scholia, rather than the lexicon, present the true idea of the student-definitions (Schulerklärung). Gattiker contends further that something like two-thirds of the Apollonius text comes from the D-scholia and the rest generally come from some initial text (unsprünglicheren Textgestalt) (Erbse 408). 

	The D-Scholia, whatever they consist of precisely, were, according to Ernst Maas, redacted in the tenth century (Gattiker 7), so the scholia, as they stand now, comprise a text coming only decades before the paraphrase. The lexicon and scholia have a “direct and immediate agreement” (daß nur zwischen der D-Scholien und dem Lexikon des Apollonius ein direkter und unmittelbarer Zusammenhung besteht, Gattiker 50). As stated above, however, there is strain of thought, a la Ludwich, that holds rather than one being derived from the other, that each represents a branch of one Ur-source that diverged around the tenth century (Ludwich 515-516). Since both share commonalities with the lexicon, the notion is, clearly, not out of the question. Whatever the precise connection is between the two, they are related. Spooner concurs, in some sense, with this point, “The continuous grammatical paraphrases on papyrus and tablets published to date match, not surprisingly, the scholia minora and D in their choice of vocabulary” (Spooner 23).

Darin besteht der Hauptgrund für die Schwierigkeit, der uspr. Charakter des Lexikons, seine Quellen und die Art und Weiss, wie diese angewandt wurden, zu bestimmen. A. stutzte sich in großem Ausmaß auf glossographisches Material, wie es in den D-Scholien zu Homer zusammengeflossen ist: hinzu kommen Beobachtungen, die auf verschiedenen wegen aus der auf Aristarchs zurück gelenden alexandrinischen Exegesestradition zu ihm gelangt waren; diese hat er in eine lexikographisches Form gebracht (Neue Pauly 885).
