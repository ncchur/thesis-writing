***Notes*** 

**VA Observations:**

- Seemingly three different hands.
>- What might be called the third hand seems to become at some point the interlinear        glosses, or at least related to it.

- Interlinear paraphrase hand seems to post-date the interlinear gloss/third hand. It seems to write around it and to avoid re-duplicating what it has already defined.
