## Suggestions for outlining your argument ##


### why are scholia important? ###

- show us texts available to ancient scholars
- inform us about ancient scholarship, its interests, methods.  (Refer here to recent scholarship by Dickey and Nunlist)

### Reading scholia in bigger context ###


- need to be read in context of where they occur in MSS:  in relation to a specific version of a text, and sts in relation to other commentary and secondary material
- this material can include things like opening 12 folios of Ven. A, can include paraphrases
- content of scholia includes material from many sources

Example of AP.Soph: single MS of work also attested in papyri, but material worked into scholiastic content

Develop argument for importance of reading this continuum of material together

### Problematic approaches in modern scholarhip ###


- treat sets of "scholia" frolm multiple MSS as a stable, single text
- isolate groups of scholia based on modern analyses or classifications

All this makes it harder to read scholia in context

Review secondary lit and point out its problems briefly

Set out in positive terms an alternative approach


### Develop your own positive argument ###
